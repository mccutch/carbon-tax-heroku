"Learn more" link in aircraft input doesn't open new tab

Single login API endpoint?

Is it better to just store prices in local currency???
 - Only return currency with a currency factor of <20??
 - Set default taxes with converted value
 - payment, taxview, taxedit, emission, emission edit fuuuuuuuuck

Test API GET when user has no objects, eg my-vehicles for new user

UX
- Landing page
- After signup 
- Improve signup form
- Link to sign up after emission
- url matching

Test login with email or username

SW
- What files need to be cached on after the sw is installed??

backdate tax change
- Show all
- Show all since last payment


Move fueltypes to constants.js to simplify cacheing

How the fuck do I test?

error try to display payments when none exist

Update smtp_key in heroku

Password reset page is terrible

Activate email on registration??

Store list of fuels in front-end instead of database?

// Set default state in emission calculator probably doesn't work

STUCK
 - Sending emails with sendgrid
    - Test contact form, set up admin email
 - Serviceworker
    - Clear user data from cache on logout

BEFORE LAUNCH
 - increase token refresh to 1 week?
 - increase access token to 24hrs?
 - increase pagination number to 15?
